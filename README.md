# Capstone_Project_Samriddhi_Bank
In today's digital age, the banking industry is continuously evolving, and
efficient management systems are essential. Developing a bank management
system project gave us the opportunity to contribute to this dynamic sector
and gain practical experience. Creating a bank management system involves
addressing real-world challenges faced by banks, such as security, data
management, and customer service. By working on this project,
we were able to experience the functioning of banks in various aspects.
We have developed a bank management system where a user can create an
account and then login using a unique login ID provided to him. We have
named our bank “SAMRIDDHI” as ‘Samriddhi’ indicates prosperity.
The program is completely based on C programming language and runs solely
on terminal.
